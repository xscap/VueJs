Here We will discuss about Vue Props which all are significantly important.

Props are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in Vue.
Think of them as “custom HTML attributes” you define for your own components.

Why Use Props?
Reusable components: Make components flexible and customizable.
One-way data flow: Data goes from parent to child, making your app easier to understand and debug.

Will be making a Demo Project in VUEjs
